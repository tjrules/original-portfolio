# But rest assured, you still have homework! #wespoilyou:grin:

-  Project Prompt
-  Portfolio Page
-  Assigned Reading
-  Blogpost


# 1) Project Prompt
You guys were given your project prompt earlier today and been given the green light  
- Now that you've been approved, you get to start! You don't have EVERYTHING you need to hit all of the requirements of the project, but you can still build out everything else that you know: 
  - Single Models, and if you're feeling adventurous, construct your second model and think about how you'd link the two 
  - Views 
  - controllers 
  - routes, 
  - configuring relevant NPM packages, 
  - finding and testing API calls using Postman or your server
- Don't be afraid to start, stop, and start again! You'll also have time after break to work on it.
- Also, keep in mind you'll still have more instruction after break, so you'll need to leave room for other stuff.
# 2) Portfolio page 
We want to you build a portfolio page that you'll use to house your projects, blogs and content that you can show to potential employers.

#### ok... but how will I build this out? :frowning:
Glad you asked! You'll be putting your Node & Express knowledge to work. Use the homeworks since the beginning of unit 2 as review and build an app. You know about MVC, routes.

#### what about the page structure/ setup?
Also glad you asked! Please follow the conventions that we discussed earlier today as to what constitutes a good profile page example.

# 4) Tech Article

Please also write a tech article about the process that went into building out your portfolio page.

## Sections

You should walk us through that process and use the sections we gathered today as a class to help structure the article. Use them as your guide to help maintain focus yet allow some artistic freedome.  Think about which snippets of code would be of value add to the article and\or which concepts most convery your level of expertise in this technology.
